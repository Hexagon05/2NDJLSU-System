# Public Assets

## Logo

The AFPLSC logo should be placed in this directory as `logo.png`.

1. Save your AFPLSC logo image as `logo.png` in this `public` folder
2. The image will be automatically referenced in the login page at `/logo.png`
3. Recommended size: 200x200px or larger
4. Format: PNG with transparent background preferred

The login page will display this logo in the top center with a nice animated effect.
